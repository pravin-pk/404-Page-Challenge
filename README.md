## ❇️ What is Hacktoberfest and how do I get started?

Hacktoberfest is a month-long celebration of open source, organised by Digital Ocean. ([More details here](https://hacktoberfest.com/participation/))

If you've never made a pull request before, or participated in an open-source project, we recommend taking a look at these resources:

- [Firstcontributions](https://github.com/firstcontributions/first-contributions)
- [Digitalocean's guide to creating your first pull request](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nkuYH40cjo4)

These two resources have everything you need to learn about open-source, with a step-by-step guide to making your very first PR. Once you've got your feet wet, you're ready to come back and dive into Hacktoberfest fun!

## ❇️ Rules

- Use HTML and CSS only! No need to use JavaScript!
- Design a 404 page (A page that is shown when the requested page does not exist).
- You are allowed to add images or any kind of assets.
- Please make sure that the code is your own, and not copied from somewhere else.

## ❇️ How to contribute

1. First up you need to fork (make a copy) of this repo to your Github account.

2. Clone (download) your fork to your computer.

3. Set your streams so you can sync your clone with the original repo (get the latest updates).

   - `git remote add upstream https://github.com/GDSC-SJEC/404-Page-Challenge.git`
   - `git pull upstream master`
   - The above 2 commands will synchronize your forked version of the project with the actual repository.

4. Create a branch.

5. In the Submissions directory (folder), create a directory named after yourself. (Eg: godnondsilva/).

6. Within this folder you just made, create two files, an HTML file, and a CSS file.

7. Link your CSS file to your HTML file.

8. Design a 404 page of your choice, it can be as simple as you want or be as complex as you want it to be.
   <br />Note: You are requested to use only HTML and CSS for this challenge.

9. Open the file `CONTRIBUTORS.md` and add your name with your github URL.
   <br />Note: The format is `- [Your Name](https://github.com/yourgithubusername)`

10. Grab a screenshot of your final design, ensuring that its nicely cropped and preferably squared. Save this in your directory using `icon.png` as the name.
    <br />Note: Make sure you have addded this screenshot since this screenshot will help us save time while verifying your work.

11. Pull from the upstream again, like we did in step 3. This is to ensure we still have the latest code.

    - `git pull upstream master`

12. Commit and push the code to your fork.

13. Create a pull request to have the changes merged from your fork into the origin.
